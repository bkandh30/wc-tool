# Build Your Own wc Tool

This is my python solution to John Crickett's Coding Challenge: [Build Your Own wc Tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of Unix command line tool wc written in Python.

It takes an input file and generates an output based on the chosen option.

There are five options supported:

generic: without an option, outputs the number of lines, words and bytes in a file.
-c: outputs the number of bytes in a file.
-l: outputs the number of lines in a file.
-w: outputs the number of words in a file.
-m: outputs the number of chars in a file.

## Dependencies

Python,

## Usage

The tool tries to follow wc syntax, the usage is as follows:

`python3 main.py ccwc [option] filename`
